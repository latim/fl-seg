# How to use

To train a classifier on the MSlesions competition data:

    - Download the MSlesions data from http://www.ia.unc.edu/MSseg/

    - Open the script 'ms_demo.m' and set the data directories. Optionally,
      open the script 'set_params.m' to modify the hyperparameters.

    - Run the script 'ms_demo.m'. This will learn features using 1 labelled
      volumes and train a logistic regression classifier using features from
      the labelled voxels with 10-fold cross validation. A sample
      segmentation is displayed.


To use the method with your own data:

    - Put your annotations in the same format as the MSlesions data. More
      specifically, each volume should have its own annotation file that 
      is in the same format as the input volume. Every pixel should have
      a label of {0,1}, with 1 indicating lesion.

    - Each volume should be a 3D array with slice indexing on the third
      dimension. For example loading/preprocessing code, check out the
      script 'load_mslesion.m' in the MSlesion08 folder.

    - From here, it should be easy to modify the 'run_mslesion.m' script
      to handle your data.


## Setup

    - It's recommended to have at least 16 GB of memory available.
      (Although 8 GB should be sufficent)

    - This code makes use of the parallel computing toolbox. If you have it 
      available, make sure to load some workers e.g. 'matlabpool open 8'. 
      This will speed up the feature extraction.

    - While we use 2 layers of feature learning for the competition, the
      number of scales is significantly more important for good vessel
      segmentation results. For simplicity and ease of use, we just include
      1 layer of learning with this code.

    - When setting the hyperparameters on your own data, try experimenting
      with the number of scales, receptive field size and number of features,
      probably in that order.
